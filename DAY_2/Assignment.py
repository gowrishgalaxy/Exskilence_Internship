Create a single inheritance program for a Library system.
Create a parent class named Book with:
title
author
display_book_details() method
Create a child class named IssuedBook that inherits from Book and adds:
issued_to
issued_date
display_issued_book_details() method
display_book_details() → shows only title and author
display_issued_book_details() → shows title, author, issued_to, issued_date
     (it calls display_book_details() from the parent class using inheritance)
Create one object of IssuedBook and display all details.
